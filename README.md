Speech Emotion Recognition Project

# MachineLearning_Project
This project focuses on developing a system for recognizing emotions from speech. It utilizes algorithms such as Numpy, Scikit-learn, Librosa, and PyAudio to analyze speech signals and extract acoustic features. 

This repository contains the code and resources for a Speech Emotion Recognition project. The project focuses on developing a system that can recognize emotions from speech signals. By leveraging various algorithms and libraries, this project aims to extract acoustic features from speech data and classify them into different emotional categories.

Features
Utilizes Numpy, Scikit-learn, Librosa, and PyAudio for speech analysis and feature extraction.
Builds emotion recognition models using Scikit-learn for classifying speech signals into emotional categories.
Extracts acoustic features such as MFCC using Librosa, enabling the transformation of audio data into meaningful representations.
Performs real-time processing of audio input using PyAudio for immediate emotion recognition.
Finds applications in emotion-based virtual assistants, sentiment analysis, voice-controlled systems, real-time emotion monitoring, and emotion-based feedback analysis.
